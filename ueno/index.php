          <h1>Ueno </h1>
<p>has lots to do. Everything is centered around Ueno Station, a major hub in Tokyo. There is the huge Ueno Park, where there is a world class zoo, hitorical museums, temples, shrines and a host of other activities. You can shop til you drop in Ameyokocho or Aemeyoko as the locals call it, where you can find some of the best bargins in the city. Then if you want some night life it's all there too. So check it out. You'll never get bored.  </p>        </div>

              <p>The National Museum of Western Art  is the premier public art gallery in Japan specializing in art from the Western tradition. It has lots of objects to see and you may find some of them familiar. I recommend going here first before visiting the other museums in Ueno Park.

               <p><img src="http://www.tokyoyestokyo.com/themes/yes-tokyo/images/kiyomizu.jpg" class="img-rounded"> </p>
              <p>The Kiyomizu Kannon-do Temple  is a copy of the famous Kiyomizu Temple in Kyoto. I've been there and it does have some similarities. This temple survived both the battle between Imperial and shogunate forces and the bombings during World War II. It's one of the oldest temples in Tokyo.
